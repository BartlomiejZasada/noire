    <h2>The Investigation</h2>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the world, the greatest treasure in automotive history is waiting to be found. A machine of impossible beauty, speed and mystery. A ghost on wheels. The Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic – La Voiture Noire – chassis 57453.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven by Jean Bugatti himself. Lost during World War II. Never recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what if we could find it?
    </p>
    <p>
      NOIRE is not just a token. It’s the ignition key to a global investigation. A community-fueled movement powered by blockchain, driven by obsession, guided by data — and elevated by belief. We are building the world’s first decentralized intelligence network for historical investigation.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology & Tactics</h2>
    <p>
      We have identified the first three priority locations where La Voiture Noire may be hidden, based on AI-powered analysis, terrain scanning, archival data and logistics from wartime Europe. The upcoming search operations will involve advanced scanning tech, aerial imagery, underground probing and more.
    </p>

    <h2>The Community</h2>
    <p>
      NOIRE is a living investigation — open to anyone with a clue, a thought, or a theory. We welcome engineers, historians, analysts, dreamers. Every message, every anomaly, every blurry photo — we’ll examine it. We will dig — with shovels, drones, scanners, even pyramid-scan technology. No method is too advanced. No detail too small. Together, we will follow every trail.
    </p>

    <h2>Funding the Mission</h2>
    <p>
      This is real. Reality comes with cost. Equipment, access, logistics — we are prepared to invest more into this mission than any car in history has ever been worth. Because what we seek is priceless. The NOIRE token will serve as the ignition mechanism for that effort.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency & Rewards</h2>
    <p>
      Everything will be public — progress reports, video logs, strategy. Contributions will be rewarded with tokens, from intel to confirmed leads. This is a bounty for truth — the first of its kind.
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Hunt</h2>
    <p>
      We don’t do this for profit. We do it for meaning. Some things are worth more than money. And this car... is one of them.
    </p>
